      The Carters had married in haste and refused to repent at leisure. So
      blindly were they in love, that they considered their marriage their
      greatest asset. The rest of the world, as represented by mutual friends,
      considered it the only thing that could be urged against either of them.
      While single, each had been popular. As a bachelor, young &ldquo;Champ&rdquo; Carter
      had filled his modest place acceptably. Hostesses sought him for dinners
      and week-end parties, men of his own years, for golf and tennis, and young
      girls liked him because when he talked to one of them he never talked of
      himself, or let his eyes wander toward any other girl. He had been brought
      up by a rich father in an expensive way, and the rich father had then died
      leaving Champneys alone in the world, with no money, and with even a few
      of his father&rsquo;s debts. These debts of honor the son, ever since leaving
      Yale, had been paying off. It had kept him very poor, for Carter had
      elected to live by his pen, and, though he wrote very carefully and
      slowly, the editors of the magazines had been equally careful and slow in
      accepting what he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an income so uncertain that the only thing that could be said of it
      with certainty was that it was too small to support even himself, Carter
      should not have thought of matrimony. Nor, must it be said to his credit,
      did he think of it until the girl came along that he wanted to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble with Dolly Ingram was her mother. Her mother was a really
      terrible person. She was quite impossible. She was a social leader, and of
      such importance that visiting princes and society reporters, even among
      themselves, did not laugh at her. Her visiting list was so small that she
      did not keep a social secretary, but, it was said, wrote her invitations
      herself. Stylites on his pillar was less exclusive. Nor did he take his
      exalted but lonely position with less sense of humor. When Ingram died and
      left her many millions to dispose of absolutely as she pleased, even to
      the allowance she should give their daughter, he left her with but one
      ambition unfulfilled. That was to marry her Dolly to an English duke.
      Hungarian princes, French marquises, Italian counts, German barons, Mrs.
      Ingram could not see. Her son-in-law must be a duke. She had her eyes on
      two, one somewhat shopworn, and the other a bankrupt; and in training, she
      had one just coming of age. Already she saw her self a sort of a dowager
      duchess by marriage, discussing with real dowager duchesses the way to
      bring up teething earls and viscounts. For three years in Europe Mrs.
      Ingram had been drilling her daughter for the part she intended her to
      play. But, on returning to her native land, Dolly, who possessed all the
      feelings, thrills, and heart-throbs of which her mother was ignorant,
      ungratefully fell deeply in love with Champneys Carter, and he with her.
      It was always a question of controversy between them as to which had first
      fallen in love with the other. As a matter of history, honors were even.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first saw her during a thunder storm, in the paddock at the races,
      wearing a rain-coat with the collar turned up and a Panama hat with the
      brim turned down. She was talking, in terms of affectionate familiarity,
      with Cuthbert&rsquo;s two-year-old, The Scout. The Scout had just lost a race by
      a nose, and Dolly was holding the nose against her cheek and comforting
      him. The two made a charming picture, and, as Carter stumbled upon it and
      halted, the race-horse lowered his eyes and seemed to say: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t YOU
      throw a race for this?&rdquo; And the girl raised her eyes and seemed to say:
      &ldquo;What a nice-looking, bright-looking young man! Why don&rsquo;t I know who you
      are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, Carter ran to find Cuthbert, and told him The Scout had gone lame.
      When, on their return, Miss Ingram refused to loosen her hold on The
      Scout&rsquo;s nose, Cuthbert apologetically mumbled Carter&rsquo;s name, and in some
      awe Miss Ingram&rsquo;s name, and then, to his surprise, both young people lost
      interest in The Scout, and wandered away together into the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour, when they parted at the club stand, for which Carter could
      not afford a ticket, he asked wistfully: &ldquo;Do you often come racing?&rdquo; and
      Miss Ingram said: &ldquo;Do you mean, am I coming to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why didn&rsquo;t you say that?&rdquo; inquired Miss Ingram. &ldquo;Otherwise I
      mightn&rsquo;t have come. I have the Holland House coach for to-morrow, and, if
      you&rsquo;ll join us, I&rsquo;ll save a place for you, and you can sit in our box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived so long abroad,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m afraid of not being
      simple and direct like other American girls. Do you think I&rsquo;ll get on here
      at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you get on with every one else as well as you&rsquo;ve got on with me,&rdquo; said
      Carter morosely, &ldquo;I will shoot myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ingram smiled thoughtfully. &ldquo;At eleven, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in front of
      the Holland House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter walked away with a flurried, heated suffocation around his heart
      and a joyous lightness in his feet. Of the first man he met he demanded,
      &ldquo;Who was the beautiful girl in the rain-coat?&rdquo; And when the man told him,
      Carter left him without speaking. For she was quite the richest girl in
      America. But the next day that fault seemed to distress her so little that
      Carter, also, refused to allow it to rest on his conscience, and they were
      very happy. And each saw that they were happy because they were together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ridiculous mother was not present at the races, but after Carter began
      to call at their house and was invited to dinner, Mrs. Ingram received him
      with her habitual rudeness. As an impediment in the success of her
      ambition she never considered him. As a boy friend of her daughter&rsquo;s, she
      classed him with &ldquo;her&rdquo; lawyer and &ldquo;her&rdquo; architect and a little higher than
      the &ldquo;person&rdquo; who arranged the flowers. Nor, in her turn, did Dolly
      consider her mother; for within two months another matter of controversy
      between Dolly and Carter was as to who had first proposed to the other.
      Carter protested there never had been any formal proposal, that from the
      first they had both taken it for granted that married they would be. But
      Dolly insisted that because he had been afraid of her money, or her
      mother, he had forced her to propose to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have loved me very much,&rdquo; she complained, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d let a
      little thing like money make you hesitate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a little thing,&rdquo; suggested Carter. &ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s several
      millions, and it happens to be YOURS. If it were MINE, now!&rdquo; &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; said
      Dolly sententiously, &ldquo;is given people to make them happy, not to make them
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until I sell my stories to the magazines,&rdquo; said Carter, &ldquo;and then I
      will be independent and can support you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plan did not strike Dolly as one likely to lead to a hasty marriage.
      But he was sensitive about his stories, and she did not wish to hurt his
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get married first,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;and then I can BUY you a
      magazine. We&rsquo;ll call it CARTER&rsquo;S MAGAZINE and we will print nothing in it
      but your stories. Then we can laugh at the editors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half as loud as they will,&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With three thousand dollars in bank and three stories accepted and
      seventeen still to hear from, and with Dolly daily telling him that it was
      evident he did not love her, Carter decided they were ready, hand in hand,
      to leap into the sea of matrimony. His interview on the subject with Mrs.
      Ingram was most painful. It lasted during the time it took her to walk out
      of her drawing-room to the foot of her staircase. She spoke to herself,
      and the only words of which Carter was sure were &ldquo;preposterous&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;intolerable insolence.&rdquo; Later in the morning she sent a note to his flat,
      forbidding him not only her daughter, but the house in which her daughter
      lived, and even the use of the United States mails and the New York
      telephone wires. She described his conduct in words that, had they come
      from a man, would have afforded Carter every excuse for violent exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately in the wake of the note arrived Dolly, in tears, and carrying
      a dressing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left mother!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;And I have her car downstairs, and a
      clergyman in it, unless he has run away. He doesn&rsquo;t want to marry us,
      because he&rsquo;s afraid mother will stop supporting his flower mission. You
      get your hat and take me where he can marry us. No mother can talk about
      the man I love the way mother talked about you, and think I won&rsquo;t marry
      him the same day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter, with her mother&rsquo;s handwriting still red before his eyes, and his
      self-love shaken with rage flourished the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no mother,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;can call ME a &lsquo;fortune-hunter&rsquo; and a
      &lsquo;cradle-robber&rsquo; and think I&rsquo;ll make good by marrying her daughter! Not
      until she BEGS me to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly swept toward him like a summer storm. Her eyes were wet and
      flashing. &ldquo;Until WHO begs you to?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;WHO are you marrying;
      mother or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I marry you,&rdquo; cried Carter, frightened but also greatly excited, &ldquo;your
      mother won&rsquo;t give you a penny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; taunted Dolly, perfectly aware that she was ridiculous, &ldquo;is
      why you won&rsquo;t marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, long enough to make her blush with shame and happiness,
      Carter grinned at her. &ldquo;Now, just for that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you,
      and I WILL marry you!&rdquo; But, as a matter of fact, he DID kiss her. Then he
      gazed happily around his small sitting-room. &ldquo;Make yourself at home here,&rdquo;
       he directed, &ldquo;while I pack my bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I MEAN to make myself very much at home here,&rdquo; said Dolly joyfully, &ldquo;for
      the rest of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the recesses of the flat Carter called: &ldquo;The rent&rsquo;s paid only till
      September. After that we live in a hall bedroom and cook on a gas-stove.
      And that&rsquo;s no idle jest, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fearing the publicity of the City Hall license bureau, they released the
      clergyman, much to the relief of that gentleman, and told the chauffeur to
      drive across the State line into Connecticut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last time we can borrow your mother&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; said Carter, &ldquo;and
      we&rsquo;d better make it go as far as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those days in May. Blue was the sky and sunshine was in the
      air, and in the park little girls from the tenements, in white, were
      playing they were queens. Dolly wanted to kidnap two of them for
      bridesmaids. In Harlem they stopped at a jeweler&rsquo;s shop, and Carter got
      out and bought a wedding-ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bronx were dogwood blossoms and leaves of tender green and beds of
      tulips, and along the Boston Post Road, on their right, the Sound flashed
      in the sunlight; and on their left, gardens, lawns, and orchards ran with
      the road, and the apple trees were masses of pink and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a car approached from the rear, Carter pretended it was Mrs.
      Ingram coming to prevent the elopement, and Dolly clung to him. When the
      car had passed, she forgot to stop clinging to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Greenwich Village they procured a license, and a magistrate married
      them, and they were a little frightened and greatly happy and, they both
      discovered simultaneously, outrageously hungry. So they drove through
      Bedford Village to South Salem, and lunched at the Horse and Hounds Inn,
      on blue and white china, in the same room where Major Andre was once a
      prisoner. And they felt very sorry for Major Andre, and for everybody who
      had not been just married that morning. And after lunch they sat outside
      in the garden and fed lumps of sugar to a charming collie and cream to a
      fat gray cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They decided to start housekeeping in Carter&rsquo;s flat, and so turned back to
      New York, this time following the old coach road through North Castle to
      White Plains, across to Tarrytown, and along the bank of the Hudson into
      Riverside Drive. Millions and millions of friendly folk, chiefly
      nurse-maids and traffic policemen, waved to them, and for some reason
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joke of it is,&rdquo; declared Carter, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t know! The most wonderful
      event of the century has just passed into history. We are married, and
      nobody knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the car drove away from in front of Carter&rsquo;s door, they saw on
      top of it two old shoes and a sign reading: &ldquo;We have just been married.&rdquo;
       While they had been at luncheon, the chauffeur had risen to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Carter soothingly, &ldquo;he meant no harm. And it&rsquo;s the only
      thing about our wedding yet that seems legal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three months later two very unhappy young people faced starvation in the
      sitting-room of Carter&rsquo;s flat. Gloom was written upon the countenance of
      each, and the heat and the care that comes when one desires to live, and
      lacks the wherewithal to fulfill that desire, had made them pallid and had
      drawn black lines under Dolly&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ingram had played her part exactly as her dearest friends had said
      she would. She had sent to Carter&rsquo;s flat, seven trunks filled with Dolly&rsquo;s
      clothes, eighteen hats, and another most unpleasant letter. In this, on
      the sole condition that Dolly would at once leave her husband, she offered
      to forgive and to support her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Dolly composed eleven scornful answers, but finally decided that
      no answer at all was the most scornful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Carter then proceeded joyfully to waste his three thousand dollars
      with that contempt for money with which on a honey-moon it should always
      be regarded. When there was no more, Dolly called upon her mother&rsquo;s
      lawyers and inquired if her father had left her anything in her own right.
      The lawyers regretted he had not, but having loved Dolly since she was
      born, offered to advance her any money she wanted. They said they felt
      sure her mother would &ldquo;relent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SHE may,&rdquo; said Dolly haughtily. &ldquo;I WON&rsquo;T! And my husband can give me all
      I need. I only wanted something of my own, because I&rsquo;m going to make him a
      surprise present of a new motor-car. The one we are using now does not
      suit us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was quite true, as the one they were then using ran through the
      subway.
    </p>
    <p>
      As summer approached, Carter had suddenly awakened to the fact that he
      soon would be a pauper, and cut short the honey-moon. They returned to the
      flat, and he set forth to look for a position. Later, while still looking
      for it, he spoke of it as a &ldquo;job.&rdquo; He first thought he would like to be an
      assistant editor of a magazine. But he found editors of magazines anxious
      to employ new and untried assistants, especially in June, were very few.
      On the contrary, they explained they were retrenching and cutting down
      expenses&mdash;they meant they had discharged all office boys who received
      more than three dollars a week. They further &ldquo;retrenched,&rdquo; by taking a
      mean advantage of Carter&rsquo;s having called upon them in person, by handing
      him three or four of his stories&mdash;but by this he saved his
      postage-stamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day, when he returned to the flat, Dolly, who always expected each
      editor would hastily dust off his chair and offer it to her brilliant
      husband, would smile excitedly and gasp, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; and Carter would throw
      the rejected manuscripts on the table and say: &ldquo;At least, I have not
      returned empty-handed.&rdquo; Then they would discover a magazine that neither
      they nor any one else knew existed, and they would hurriedly readdress the
      manuscripts to that periodical, and run to post them at the letter-box on
      the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one of them, if ACCEPTED,&rdquo; Carter would point out, &ldquo;might bring us in
      twenty-five dollars. A story of mine once sold for forty; so to-night we
      can afford to dine at a restaurant where wine is NOT &lsquo;included.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, they never lost their sense of humor. Otherwise the narrow
      confines of the flat, the evil smells that rose from the baked streets,
      the greasy food of Italian and Hungarian restaurants, and the
      ever-haunting need of money might have crushed their youthful spirits. But
      in time even they found that one, still less two, cannot exist exclusively
      on love and the power to see the bright side of things&mdash;especially
      when there is no bright side. They had come to the point where they must
      borrow money from their friends, and that, though there were many who
      would have opened their safes to them, they had agreed was the one thing
      they would not do, or they must starve. The alternative was equally
      distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carter had struggled earnestly to find a job. But his inexperience and the
      season of the year were against him. No newspaper wanted a dramatic critic
      when the only shows in town had been running three months, and on roof
      gardens; nor did they want a &ldquo;cub&rdquo; reporter when veterans were being &ldquo;laid
      off&rdquo; by the dozens. Nor were his services desired as a private secretary,
      a taxicab driver, an agent to sell real estate or automobiles or stocks.
      As no one gave him a chance to prove his unfitness for any of these
      callings, the fact that he knew nothing of any of them did not greatly
      matter. At these rebuffs Dolly was distinctly pleased. She argued they
      proved he was intended to pursue his natural career as an author.
    </p>
    <p>
      That their friends might know they were poor did not affect her, but she
      did not want them to think by his taking up any outside &ldquo;job&rdquo; that they
      were poor because as a literary genius he was a failure. She believed in
      his stories. She wanted every one else to believe in them. Meanwhile, she
      assisted him in so far as she could by pawning the contents of five of the
      seven trunks, by learning to cook on a &ldquo;Kitchenette,&rdquo; and to laundry her
      handkerchiefs and iron them on the looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      They faced each other across the breakfast-table. It was only nine
      o&rsquo;clock, but the sun beat into the flat with the breath of a furnace, and
      the air was foul and humid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; Carter was saying fiercely, &ldquo;you look ill. You are ill. You
      must go to the sea-shore. You must visit some of your proud friends at
      East Hampton or Newport. Then I&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re happy and I won&rsquo;t worry,
      and I&rsquo;ll find a job. I don&rsquo;t mind the heat&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll write you love
      letters&rdquo;&mdash;he was talking very fast and not looking at Dolly&mdash;&ldquo;like
      those I used to write you, before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly raised her hand. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Suppose I leave you. What will
      happen? I&rsquo;ll wake up in a cool, beautiful brass bed, won&rsquo;t I&mdash;with
      cretonne window-curtains, and salt air blowing them about, and a maid to
      bring me coffee. And instead of a bathroom like yours, next to an elevator
      shaft and a fire-escape, I&rsquo;ll have one as big as a church, and the whole
      blue ocean to swim in. And I&rsquo;ll sit on the rocks in the sunshine and watch
      the waves and the yachts&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And grow well again!&rdquo; cried Carter. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll write to me,&rdquo; he added
      wistfully, &ldquo;every day, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her wrath, Dolly rose, and from across the table confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will I be doing on those rocks?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You KNOW what I&rsquo;ll
      be doing! I&rsquo;ll be sobbing, and sobbing, and calling out to the waves: &lsquo;Why
      did he send me away? Why doesn&rsquo;t he want me? Because he doesn&rsquo;t love me.
      That&rsquo;s why! He doesn&rsquo;t LOVE me!&rsquo; And you DON&rsquo;T!&rdquo; cried Dolly. &ldquo;You DON&rsquo;T!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took him all of three minutes to persuade her she was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; sobbed Dolly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s settled. And there&rsquo;ll be no more
      talk of sending me away!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will NOT!&rdquo; said Champneys hastily. &ldquo;We will now,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;go
      into committee of the whole and decide how we are to face financial
      failure. Our assets consist of two stories, accepted, but not paid for,
      and fifteen stories not accepted.&rdquo; In cash, he spread upon the table a
      meagre collection of soiled bills and coins. &ldquo;We have twenty-seven dollars
      and fourteen cents. That is every penny we possess in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly regarded him fixedly and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it wicked,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to love you so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been listening to me?&rdquo; demanded Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Dolly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was watching the way you talk. When your lips move fast they do such
      charming things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; roared Carter, &ldquo;that we haven&rsquo;t a penny in the world, that
      we have nothing in this flat to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still have five hats,&rdquo; said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t eat hats,&rdquo; protested Champneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can sell hats!&rdquo; returned Dolly. &ldquo;They cost eighty dollars apiece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you need money,&rdquo; explained Carter, &ldquo;I find it&rsquo;s just as hard to sell
      a hat as to eat it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-seven dollars and fourteen cents,&rdquo; repeated Dolly. She exclaimed
      remorsefully: &ldquo;And you started with three thousand! What did I do with
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We both had the time of our lives with it!&rdquo; said Carter stoutly. &ldquo;And
      that&rsquo;s all there is to that. Post-mortems,&rdquo; he pointed out, &ldquo;are useful
      only as guides to the future, and as our future will never hold a second
      three thousand dollars, we needn&rsquo;t worry about how we spent the first one.
      No! What we must consider now is how we can grow rich quick, and the
      quicker and richer, the better. Pawning our clothes, or what&rsquo;s left of
      them, is bad economics. There&rsquo;s no use considering how to live from meal
      to meal. We must evolve something big, picturesque, that will bring a
      fortune. You have imagination; I&rsquo;m supposed to have imagination, we must
      think of a plan to get money, much money. I do not insist on our plan
      being dignified, or even outwardly respectable; so long as it keeps you
      alive, it may be as desperate as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; cried Dolly; &ldquo;like sending mother Black Hand letters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackmail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began that lady&rsquo;s son-in-law doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or!&rdquo; cried Dolly, &ldquo;we might kidnap Mr. Carnegie when he&rsquo;s walking in the
      park alone, and hold him for ransom. Or&rdquo;&mdash;she rushed on&mdash;&ldquo;we
      might forge a codicil to father&rsquo;s will, and make it say if mother
      shouldn&rsquo;t like the man I want to marry, all of father&rsquo;s fortune must go to
      my husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgery,&rdquo; exclaimed Champneys, &ldquo;is going further than I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another plan,&rdquo; interrupted Dolly, &ldquo;that I have always had in mind, is
      to issue a cheaper edition of your book, &lsquo;The Dead Heat.&rsquo; The reason the
      first edition of &lsquo;The Dead Heat&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t sell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell ME why it didn&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; said Champneys. &ldquo;I wrote it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That book,&rdquo; declared Dolly loyally, &ldquo;was never properly advertised. No
      one knew about it, so no one bought it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven people bought it!&rdquo; corrected the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will put it in a paper cover and sell it for fifty cents,&rdquo; cried
      Dolly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best detective story I ever read, and people have got to
      know it is the best. So we&rsquo;ll advertise it like a breakfast food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; interrupted Champneys, &ldquo;is to make money, not throw it away.
      Besides, we haven&rsquo;t any to throw away. Dolly sighed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;we had that three thousand dollars back again!
      I&rsquo;d save SO carefully. It was all my fault. The races took it, but it was
      I took you to the races.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever had to drag ME to the races,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;It was the way we
      went that was extravagant. Automobiles by the hour standing idle, and a
      box each day, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And always backing Dromedary,&rdquo; suggested Dolly. Carter was touched on a
      sensitive spot. &ldquo;That horse,&rdquo; he protested loudly, &ldquo;is a mighty good
      horse. Some day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you always said,&rdquo; remarked Dolly, &ldquo;but he never seems to have
      his day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Champneys consciously. &ldquo;I dreamed of Dromedary only
      last night. Same dream over and over again.&rdquo; Hastily he changed the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some reason I don&rsquo;t sleep well. I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly looked at him with all the love in her eyes of a mother over her
      ailing infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worrying over me, and the heat,&rdquo;&rsquo; she said. &ldquo;And the garage next
      door, and the skyscraper going up across the street, might have something
      to do with it. And YOU,&rdquo; she mocked tenderly, &ldquo;wanted to send me to the
      sea-shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter was frowning. As though about to speak, he opened his lips, and
      then laughed embarrassedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it,&rdquo; said Dolly, with an encouraging smile. &ldquo;Did he win?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing she had read what was in his mind, Carter leaned forward eagerly.
      The ruling passion and a touch of superstition held him in their grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;win&rsquo; each time,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I saw it as plain as I see you. Each
      time he came up with a rush just at the same place, just as they entered
      the stretch, and each time he won!&rdquo; He slapped his hand disdainfully upon
      the dirty bills before him. &ldquo;If I had a hundred dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door, and Carter opened it to the elevator boy
      with the morning mail. The letters, save one, Carter dropped upon the
      table. That one, with clumsy fingers, he tore open. He exclaimed
      breathlessly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from PLYMPTON&rsquo;S MAGAZINE! Maybe&mdash;I&rsquo;ve sold a
      story!&rdquo; He gave a cry almost of alarm. His voice was as solemn as though
      the letter had announced a death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a check&mdash;a check for a HUNDRED DOLLARS!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guiltily, the two young people looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve GOT to!&rdquo; breathed Dolly. &ldquo;GOT to! If we let TWO signs like that
      pass, we&rsquo;d be flying in the face of Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her hands gripping the arms of her chair, she leaned forward, her
      eyes staring into space, her lips moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;COME ON, you Dromedary!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They changed the check into five and ten dollar bills, and, as Carter was
      far too excited to work, made an absurdly early start for the race-track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well get all the fresh air we can,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all
      we will get!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From their reserve fund of twenty-seven dollars which each had solemnly
      agreed with the other would not be risked on race-horses, Dolly subtracted
      a two-dollar bill. This she stuck conspicuously across the face of the
      clock on the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get back this evening,&rdquo; Dolly explained, &ldquo;that will be the first
      thing we&rsquo;ll see. It&rsquo;s going to look awfully good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This day there was no scarlet car to rush them with refreshing swiftness
      through Brooklyn&rsquo;s parkways and along the Ocean Avenue. Instead, they hung
      to a strap in a cross-town car, changed to the ferry, and again to the
      Long Island Railroad. When Carter halted at the special car of the Turf
      Club, Dolly took his arm and led him forward to the day coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Carter, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re spending a hundred dollars with one
      hand, why grudge fifty cents for a parlor-car seat? If you&rsquo;re going to be
      a sport, be a sport.&rdquo; &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;ve got to be a piker,&rdquo; said Dolly,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be ashamed to be a piker. We&rsquo;re not spending a hundred dollars
      because we can afford it, but because you dreamt a dream. You didn&rsquo;t dream
      you were riding in parlor-cars! If you did, it&rsquo;s time I woke you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This day there was for them no box overlooking the finish, no club-house
      luncheon. With the other pikers, they sat in the free seats, with those
      who sat coatless and tucked their handkerchiefs inside their collars, and
      with those who mopped their perspiring countenances with rice-paper and
      marked their cards with a hat-pin. Their lunch consisted of a massive ham
      sandwich with a top dressing of mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dromedary did not run until the fifth race, and the long wait, before they
      could learn their fate, was intolerable. They knew most of the horses,
      and, to pass the time, on each of the first races Dolly made imaginary
      bets. Of these mental wagers, she lost every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you turn out to be as bad a guesser when you&rsquo;re asleep as I am when
      I&rsquo;m awake,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to lose our fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m weakening!&rdquo; declared Carter. &ldquo;A hundred dollars is beginning to look
      to me like an awful lot of money. Twenty-seven dollars, and there&rsquo;s only
      twenty of that left now, is mighty small capital, but twenty dollars plus
      a hundred could keep us alive for a month!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, or did you not, dream that Dromedary would win?&rdquo; demanded Dolly
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did, several times,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;But it may be I was
      thinking of the horse. I&rsquo;ve lost such a lot on him, my mind may have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you,&rdquo; interrupted Dolly, &ldquo;say if you had a hundred dollars you&rsquo;d bet
      it, and did a hundred dollars walk in through the door instantly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter, reassured, breathed again. &ldquo;It certainly did!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in his proud days, Carter had never been able to bet heavily, and
      instead of troubling the club-house commissioners with his small wagers,
      he had, in the ring, bet ready money. Moreover, he believed in the ring he
      obtained more favorable odds, and, when he won, it pleased him, instead of
      waiting until settling day for a check, to stand in a line and feel the
      real money thrust into his hand. So, when the fourth race started he rose
      and raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking at him, Dolly nodded. She was far too tremulous to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several weeks Dromedary had not been placed, and Carter hoped for odds
      of at least ten to one. But, when he pushed his way into the arena, he
      found so little was thought of his choice that as high as twenty to one
      was being offered, and with few takers. The fact shattered his confidence.
      Here were two hundred book-makers, trained to their calling, anxious at
      absurd odds to back their opinion that the horse he liked could not win.
      In the face of such unanimous contempt, his dream became fantastic,
      fatuous. He decided he would risk only half of his fortune. Then, should
      the horse win, he still would be passing rich, and should he lose, he
      would, at least, have all of fifty dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a book-maker he wagered that sum, and then, in unhappy indecision,
      stood, in one hand clutching his ticket that called for a potential
      thousand and fifty dollars, and in the other an actual fifty. It was not a
      place for meditation. From every side men, more or less sane, swept upon
      him, jostled him, and stamped upon him, and still, struggling for a
      foothold, he swayed, hesitating. Then he became conscious that the ring
      was nearly empty, that only a few shrieking individuals still ran down the
      line. The horses were going to the post. He must decide quickly. In front
      of him the book-maker cleaned his board, and, as a final appeal, opposite
      the names of three horses chalked thirty to one. Dromedary was among them.
      Such odds could not be resisted. Carter shoved his fifty at the man, and
      to that sum added the twenty dollars still in his pocket. They were the
      last dollars he owned in the world. And though he knew they were his last,
      he was fearful lest the book-maker would refuse them. But, mechanically,
      the man passed them over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And twenty-one hundred to seventy,&rdquo; he chanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carter took his seat beside Dolly, he was quite cold. Still, Dolly
      did not speak. Out of the corner of her eyes she questioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got fifty at twenty to one,&rdquo; replied Carter, &ldquo;and seventy at thirty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In alarm, Dolly turned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SEVENTY!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carter nodded. &ldquo;All we have,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have sixty cents left, to start
      life over again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As though to encourage him, Dolly placed her finger on her race-card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His colors,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are &lsquo;green cap, green jacket, green and white
      hoops.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through a maze of heat, a half-mile distant, at the starting-gate, little
      spots of color moved in impatient circles. The big, good-natured crowd had
      grown silent, so silent that from the high, sun-warmed grass in the
      infield one could hear the lazy chirp of the crickets. As though repeating
      a prayer, or an incantation, Dolly&rsquo;s lips were moving quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green cap,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;green jacket, green and white hoops!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp sigh the crowd broke the silence. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; it cried,
      and leaned forward expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses came so fast. To Carter their conduct seemed outrageous. It was
      incredible that in so short a time, at a pace so reckless, they would
      decide a question of such moment. They came bunched together, shifting and
      changing, with, through the dust, flashes of blue and gold and scarlet. A
      jacket of yellow shot out of the dust and showed in front; a jacket of
      crimson followed. So they were at the half; so they were at the
      three-quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured crowd began to sway, to grumble and murmur, then to shout
      in sharp staccato.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see him?&rdquo; begged Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see him until they reach the stretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One could hear their hoofs, could see the crimson jockey draw his whip. At
      the sight, for he rode the favorite, the crowd gave a great gasp of
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you Gold Heels!&rdquo; it implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the whip, Gold Heels drew even with the yellow jacket; stride by
      stride, they fought it out alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold Heels!&rdquo; cried the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind them, in a curtain of dust, pounded the field. It charged in a
      flying wedge, like a troop of cavalry. Dolly, searching for a green
      jacket, saw, instead, a rainbow wave of color that, as it rose and fell,
      sprang toward her in great leaps, swallowing the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold Heels!&rdquo; yelled the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field swept into the stretch. Without moving his eyes, Carter caught
      Dolly by the wrist and pointed. As though giving a signal, he shot his
      free hand into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the curtain of dust, as lightning strikes through a cloud, darted a
      great, raw-boned, ugly chestnut. Like the Empire Express, he came rocking,
      thundering, spurning the ground. At his coming, Gold Heels, to the eyes of
      the crowd, seemed to falter, to slacken, to stand still. The crowd gave a
      great cry of amazement, a yell of disgust. The chestnut drew even with
      Gold Heels, passed him, and swept under the wire. Clinging to his neck was
      a little jockey in a green cap, green jacket, and hoops of green and
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly&rsquo;s hand was at her side, clutching the bench. Carter&rsquo;s hand still
      clasped it. Neither spoke or looked at the other. For an instant, while
      the crowd, no longer so good-natured, mocked and jeered at itself, the two
      young people sat quite still, staring at the green field, at the white
      clouds rolling from the ocean. Dolly drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s thank him first, and then take me home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found Dromedary in the paddock, and thanked him, and Carter left
      Dolly with him, while he ran to collect his winnings. When he returned, he
      showed her a sheaf of yellow bills, and as they ran down the covered board
      walk to the gate, they skipped and danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly turned toward the train drawn up at the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with me!&rdquo; shouted Carter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home in the reddest, most
      expensive, fastest automobile I can hire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the &ldquo;hack&rdquo; line of motor-cars was one that answered those requirements,
      and they fell into it as though it were their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Night and Day Bank!&rdquo; commanded Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the genial democracy of the race-track, the chauffeur lifted his head
      to grin appreciatively. &ldquo;That listens good to me!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him!&rdquo; whispered Dolly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s buy him and the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, they bought many cars; every car they saw, that they
      liked, they bought. They bought, also, several houses, and a yacht that
      they saw from the ferry-boat. And as soon as they had deposited the most
      of their money in the bank, they went to a pawnshop in Sixth Avenue and
      bought back many possessions that they had feared they never would see
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the flat, the thing they first beheld was Dolly&rsquo;s
      two-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; demanded Carter, with repugnance, &ldquo;is that strange piece of
      paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly examined it carefully. &ldquo;I think it is a kind of money,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;used by the lower classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dined on the roof at Delmonico&rsquo;s. Dolly wore the largest of the five
      hats still unsold, and Carter selected the dishes entirely according to
      which was the most expensive. Every now and again they would look
      anxiously down across the street at the bank that held their money. They
      were nervous lest it should take fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can be extravagant to-night,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;because we owe it to
      Dromedary to celebrate. But from to-night on we must save. We&rsquo;ve had an
      awful lesson. What happened to us last month must never happen again. We
      were down to a two-dollar bill. Now we have twenty-five hundred across the
      street, and you have several hundreds in your pocket. On that we can live
      easily for a year. Meanwhile, you can write &lsquo;the&rsquo; great American novel
      without having to worry about money, or to look for a steady job. And then
      your book will come out, and you will be famous, and rich, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing on from that,&rdquo; interrupted Carter, &ldquo;the thing of first importance
      is to get you out of that hot, beastly flat. I propose we start to-morrow
      for Cape Cod. I know a lot of fishing villages there where we could board
      and lodge for twelve dollars a week, and row and play tennis and live in
      our bathing suits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly assented with enthusiasm, and during the courses of the dinner they
      happily discussed Cape Cod from Pocasset to Yarmouth, and from Sandwich to
      Provincetown. So eager were they to escape, that Carter telephoned the
      hallman at his club to secure a cabin for the next afternoon on the Fall
      River boat. As they sat over their coffee in the cool breeze, with, in the
      air, the scent of flowers and the swing of music, and with, at their feet,
      the lights of the great city, the world seemed very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a great day,&rdquo; sighed Carter. &ldquo;And if I hadn&rsquo;t had nervous
      prostration I would have enjoyed it. That race-course is always cool, and
      there were some fine finishes. I noticed two horses that would bear
      watching, Her Highness and Glowworm. If we weren&rsquo;t leaving to-morrow, I&rsquo;d
      be inclined&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dolly regarded him with eyes of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champneys Carter!&rdquo; she exclaimed. As she said it, it sounded like &ldquo;Great
      Jehoshaphat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter protested indignantly. &ldquo;I only said,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;if I were
      following the races, I&rsquo;d watch those horses. Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;I know when to stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they took breakfast on the tiny terrace of a restaurant
      overlooking Bryant Park, where, during the first days of their honeymoon,
      they had always breakfasted. For sentimental reasons they now revisited
      it. But Dolly was eager to return at once to the flat and pack, and Carter
      seemed distraught. He explained that he had had a bad night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; sympathized Dolly, &ldquo;but to-night you will have a fine
      sleep going up the Sound. Any more nightmares?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nightmares!&rdquo; exploded Carter fiercely. &ldquo;Nightmares they certainly were! I
      dreamt two of the nightmares won! I saw them, all night, just as I saw
      Dromedary, Her Highness and Glowworm, winning, winning, winning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were the horses you spoke about last night,&rdquo; said Dolly severely.
      &ldquo;After so wonderful a day, of course you dreamt of racing, and those two
      horses were in your mind. That&rsquo;s the explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the flat and began, industriously, to pack. About twelve
      o&rsquo;clock Carter, coming suddenly into the bedroom where Dolly was alone,
      found her reading the MORNING TELEGRAPH. It was open at the racing page of
      &ldquo;past performances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the paper guiltily. Carter kicked a hat-box out of his way and
      sat down on a trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;why we can&rsquo;t wait one more day. We&rsquo;d be just as
      near the ocean at Sheepshead Bay race-track as on a Fall River boat, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He halted and frowned unhappily. &ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t bet more than ten dollars,&rdquo;
       he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; declared Dolly, &ldquo;if they SHOULD win, you&rsquo;ll always blame ME!&rdquo;
       Carter&rsquo;s eyes shone hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Dolly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to have you blame me. So&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your hat!&rdquo; shouted Carter, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll miss the first race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter telephoned for a cab, and as they were entering it said guiltily:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to stop at the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have NOT!&rdquo; announced Dolly. &ldquo;That money is to keep us alive while you
      write the great American novel. I&rsquo;m glad to spend another day at the
      races, and I&rsquo;m willing to back your dreams as far as ten dollars, but for
      no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my dreams come true,&rdquo; warned Carter, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be awfully sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll merely send you to bed, and you can go on
      dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Her Highness romped home, an easy winner, the look Dolly turned upon
      her husband was one both of fear and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s uncanny. It gives me a
      creepy feeling. It makes you seem sort of supernatural. And oh,&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;if only I had let you bet all you had with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; stammered Carter, in extreme agitation. &ldquo;I bet four hundred. I
      got five to one, Dolly,&rdquo; he gasped, in awe; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve won two thousand
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly exclaimed rapturously: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it all in bank,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it all on Glowworm!&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champ!&rdquo; begged Dolly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push your luck. Stop while&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Carter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s NOT luck!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gift, it&rsquo;s second sight, it&rsquo;s
      prophecy. I&rsquo;ve been a full-fledged clairvoyant all my life, and didn&rsquo;t
      know it. Anyway, I&rsquo;m a sport, and after two of my dreams breaking right,
      I&rsquo;ve got to back the third one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glowworm was at ten to one, and at those odds the book-makers to whom he
      first applied did not care to take so large a sum as he offered. Carter
      found a book-maker named &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; Burbank who, at those odds, accepted his
      two thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carter returned to collect his twenty-two thousand, there was some
      little delay while Burbank borrowed a portion of it. He looked at Carter
      curiously and none too genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it you,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that had that thirty-to-one shot yesterday on
      Dromedary?&rdquo; Carter nodded somewhat guiltily. A man in the crowd
      volunteered: &ldquo;And he had Her Highness in the second, too, for four
      hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a good day,&rdquo; said Burbank. &ldquo;Give me a chance to get my money
      back to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving New York to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same scarlet car bore them back triumphant to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-two thousand dollars?&rdquo; gasped Carter, &ldquo;in CASH! How in the name of
      all that&rsquo;s honest can we celebrate winning twenty-two thousand dollars? We
      can&rsquo;t eat more than one dinner; we can&rsquo;t drink more than two quarts of
      champagne&mdash;not without serious results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can do!&rdquo; cried Dolly excitedly. &ldquo;We can sail
      to-morrow on the CAMPANIA!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Carter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a second honey-moon. We&rsquo;ll shoot up
      London and Paris. We&rsquo;ll tear slices out of the map of Europe. You&rsquo;ll ride
      in one motor-car, I&rsquo;ll ride in another, we&rsquo;ll have a maid and a valet in a
      third, and we&rsquo;ll race each other all the way to Monte Carlo. And, there,
      I&rsquo;ll dream of the winning numbers, and we&rsquo;ll break the bank. When does the
      CAMPANIA sail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At noon,&rdquo; said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eight we will be on board,&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night in his dreams he saw King Pepper, Confederate, and Red Wing
      each win a race. And in the morning neither the engines of the CAMPANIA
      nor the entreaties of Dolly could keep him from the race-track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want only six thousand,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You can do what you like with
      the rest, but I am going to bet six thousand on the first one of those
      three to start. If he loses, I give you my word I&rsquo;ll not bet another cent,
      and we&rsquo;ll sail on Saturday. If he wins Out, I&rsquo;ll put all I make on the two
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; begged Dolly, &ldquo;that your dreams are just a rehash of what
      you think during the day? You have been playing in wonderful luck, that&rsquo;s
      all. Each of those horses is likely to win his race. When he does you will
      have more faith than ever in your silly dreams&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My silly dreams,&rdquo; said Carter grinning, &ldquo;are carrying you to Europe,
      first class, by the next steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been talking while on their way to the bank. When Dolly saw she
      could not alter his purpose, she made him place the nineteen thousand that
      remained, after he had taken out the six thousand, in her name. She then
      drew out the entire amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me,&rdquo; said Dolly, smiling anxiously, &ldquo;I could do what I liked
      with it. Maybe I have dreams also. Maybe I mean to back them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drove away, mysteriously refusing to tell him what she intended to do.
      When they met at luncheon, she was still much excited, still bristling
      with a concealed secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you back your dream?&rdquo; asked Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly nodded happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when am I to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will read of it,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;to-morrow, in the morning papers. It&rsquo;s
      all quite correct. My lawyers arranged it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawyers!&rdquo; gasped her husband. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not arranging to lock me in a
      private madhouse, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Dolly; &ldquo;but when I told them how I intended to invest the
      money they came near putting me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they want to know how you suddenly got so rich?&rdquo; asked Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did. I told them it came from my husband&rsquo;s &lsquo;books&rsquo;! It was a very
      &lsquo;near&rsquo; false-hood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was worse,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;It was a very poor pun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As in their honey-moon days they drove proudly to the track, and when
      Carter had placed Dolly in a box large enough for twenty, he pushed his
      way into the crowd around the stand of &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; Burbank. That veteran of the
      turf welcomed him gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming to give me my money back?&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, to take some away,&rdquo; said Carter, handing him his six thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without apparently looking at it, Burbank passed it to his cashier. &ldquo;King
      Pepper, twelve to six thousand,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      When King Pepper won, and Carter moved around the ring with eighteen
      thousand dollars in thousand and five hundred dollar bills in his fist, he
      found himself beset by a crowd of curious, eager &ldquo;pikers.&rdquo; They both
      impeded his operations and acted as a body-guard. Confederate was an
      almost prohibitive favorite at one to three, and in placing eighteen
      thousand that he might win six, Carter found little difficulty. When
      Confederate won, and he started with his twenty-four thousand to back Red
      Wing, the crowd now engulfed him. Men and boys who when they wagered five
      and ten dollars were risking their all, found in the sight of a young man
      offering bets in hundreds and thousands a thrilling and fascinating
      spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn what horse he was playing and at what odds, racing touts and
      runners for other book-makers and individual speculators leaped into the
      mob that surrounded him, and then, squirming their way out, ran shrieking
      down the line. In ten minutes, through the bets of Carter and those that
      backed his luck, the odds against Red Wing were forced down from fifteen
      to one to even money. His approach was hailed by the book-makers either
      with jeers or with shouts of welcome. Those who had lost demanded a chance
      to regain their money. Those with whom he had not bet, found in that fact
      consolation, and chaffed the losers. Some curtly refused even the smallest
      part of his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with me!&rdquo; they laughed. From stand to stand the layers of odds
      taunted him, or each other. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it, it&rsquo;s tainted!&rdquo; they shouted.
      &ldquo;Look out, Joe, he&rsquo;s the Jonah man?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Come at me again!&rdquo; they called.
      &ldquo;And, once more!&rdquo; they challenged as they reached for a thousand-dollar
      bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when in time, each shook his head and grumbled: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want,&rdquo;
       or looked the other way, the mob around Carter jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fought &lsquo;em to a stand-still!&rdquo; they shouted jubilantly. In their eyes
      a man who alone was able and willing to wipe the name of a horse off the
      blackboards was a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the horror of Dolly, instead of watching the horses parade past, the
      crowd gathered in front of her box and pointed and stared at her. From the
      club-house her men friends and acquaintances invaded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Carter gone mad?&rdquo; they demanded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dealing out thousand-dollar
      bills like cigarettes. He&rsquo;s turned the ring into a wheat Pit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the box a sun-burned man in a sombrero blocked his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the owner of Red Wing,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;bred him and trained him
      myself. I know he&rsquo;ll be lucky if he gets the place. You&rsquo;re backing him in
      thousands to WIN. What do you know about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know he will win,&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran commissioner of the club stand buttonholed him. &ldquo;Mr. Carter,&rdquo;
       he begged, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you bet through me? I&rsquo;ll give you as good odds as
      they will in that ring. You don&rsquo;t want your clothes torn off you and your
      money taken from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t taken such a lot of it yet,&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Red Wing won, the crowd beneath the box, the men in the box, and the
      people standing around it, most of whom had followed Carter&rsquo;s plunge,
      cheered and fell over him, to shake hands and pound him on the back. From
      every side excited photographers pointed cameras, and Lander&rsquo;s band
      played: &ldquo;Every Little Bit Added to What You&rsquo;ve Got Makes Just a Little Bit
      More.&rdquo; As he left the box to collect his money, a big man with a brown
      mustache and two smooth-shaven giants closed in around him, as tackles
      interfere for the man who has the ball. The big man took him by the arm.
      Carter shook himself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Pinkerton,&rdquo; said the big man genially. &ldquo;You need a body-guard. If
      you&rsquo;ve got an empty seat in your car, I&rsquo;ll drive home with you. From
      Cavanaugh they borrowed a book-maker&rsquo;s hand-bag and stuffed it with
      thousand-dollar bills. When they stepped into the car the crowd still
      surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking it home in a trunk!&rdquo; they yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the &ldquo;sporting extras&rdquo; of the afternoon papers gave prominence
      to the luck at the races of Champneys Carter. From Cavanaugh and the
      book-makers, the racing reporters had gathered accounts of his winnings.
      They stated that in three successive days, starting with one hundred
      dollars, he had at the end of the third day not lost a single bet, and
      that afternoon, on the last race alone, he had won sixty to seventy
      thousand dollars. With the text, they &ldquo;ran&rdquo; pictures of Carter at the
      track, of Dolly in her box, and of Mrs. Ingram in a tiara and ball-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother-in-law WILL be pleased cried Carter. In some alarm as to what the
      newspapers might say on the morrow, he ordered that in the morning a copy
      of each be sent to his room. That night in his dreams he saw clouds of
      dust-covered jackets and horses with sweating flanks, and one of them
      named Ambitious led all the rest. When he woke, he said to Dolly: &ldquo;That
      horse Ambitious will win to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can do just as he likes about THAT!&rdquo; replied Dolly. &ldquo;I have something
      on my mind much more important than horse-racing. To-day you are to learn
      how I spent your money. It&rsquo;s to be in the morning papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came to breakfast, Dolly was on her knees. For his inspection she
      had spread the newspapers on the floor, opened at an advertisement that
      appeared in each. In the Centre of a half-page of white paper were the
      lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SOLD OUT IN ONE DAY!

     ENTIRE FIRST EDITION

     THE DEAD HEAT

     BY

     CHAMPNEYS CARTER

     SECOND EDITION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; roared Carter. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; cried Dolly tremulously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m backing my dream. I&rsquo;ve always
      believed in your book. Now, I&rsquo;m backing it. Our lawyers sent me to an
      advertising agent. His name is Spink, and he is awfully clever. I asked
      him if he could advertise a book so as to make it sell. He said with my
      money and his ideas he could sell last year&rsquo;s telephone book to people who
      did not own a telephone, and who had never learned to read. He is proud of
      his ideas. One of them was buying out the first edition. Your publishers
      told him your book was &lsquo;waste paper,&rsquo; and that he could have every copy in
      stock for the cost of the plates. So he bought the whole edition. That&rsquo;s
      how it was sold out in one day. Then we ordered a second edition of one
      hundred thousand, and they&rsquo;re printing it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The presses have been working all night to meet the demand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Carter, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t any demand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;when five million people read our
      advertisements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dragged him to the window and pointed triumphantly into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Spink sent them here for me to inspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawn up in a line that stretched from Fifth Avenue to Broadway were an
      army of sandwich men. On the boards they carried were the words: &ldquo;Read
      &lsquo;The Dead Heat.&rsquo; Second Edition. One Hundred Thousand!&rdquo; On the fence in
      front of the building going up across the street, in letters a foot high,
      Carter again read the name of his novel. In letters in size more modest,
      but in colors more defiant, it glared at him from ash-cans and barrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much does this cost?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cost every dollar you had in bank,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;and before we are
      through it will cost you twice as much more. Mr. Spink is only waiting to
      hear from me before he starts spending fifty thousand dollars; that&rsquo;s only
      half of what you won on Red Wing. I&rsquo;m only waiting for you to make me out
      a check before I tell Spink to start spending it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a dazed state Carter drew a check for fifty thousand dollars and meekly
      handed it to his wife. They carried it themselves to the office of Mr.
      Spink. On their way, on every side they saw evidences of his handiwork. On
      walls, on scaffolding, on bill-boards were advertisements of &ldquo;The Dead
      Heat.&rdquo; Over Madison Square a huge kite as large as a Zeppelin air-ship
      painted the name of the book against the sky, on &ldquo;dodgers&rdquo; it floated in
      the air, on handbills it stared up from the gutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spink was a nervous young man with a bald head and eye-glasses. He
      grasped the check as a general might welcome fifty thousand fresh troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reinforcements!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Now, watch me. Now I can do things that are
      big, national, Napoleonic. We can&rsquo;t get those books bound inside of a
      week, but meanwhile orders will be pouring in, people will be growing
      crazy for it. Every man, woman, and child in Greater New York will want a
      copy. I&rsquo;ve sent out fifty boys dressed as jockeys on horseback to ride
      neck and neck up and down every avenue. &lsquo;The Dead Heat&rsquo; is printed on the
      saddle-cloth. Half of them have been arrested already. It&rsquo;s a little idea
      of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Carter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a racing story, it&rsquo;s a detective
      story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil it is!&rdquo; gasped Spink. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the difference!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to buy it anyway. They&rsquo;d buy it if it was a
      cook-book. And, I say,&rdquo; he cried delightedly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s great press work
      you&rsquo;re doing for the book at the races! The papers are full of you this
      morning, and every man who reads about your luck at the track will see
      your name as the author of &lsquo;The Dead Heat,&rsquo; and will rush to buy the book.
      He&rsquo;ll think &lsquo;The Dead Heat&rsquo; is a guide to the turf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Carter reached the track he found his notoriety had preceded him.
      Ambitious did not run until the fourth race, and until then, as he sat in
      his box, an eager crowd surged below. He had never known such popularity.
      The crowd had read the newspapers, and such head-lines as &ldquo;He Cannot
      Lose!&rdquo; &ldquo;Young Carter Wins $70,000!&rdquo; &ldquo;Boy Plunger Wins Again!&rdquo; &ldquo;Carter
      Makes Big Killing!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ring Hit Hard!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Man Who Cannot Lose!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Carter Beats Book-makers!&rdquo; had whetted their curiosity and filled many
      with absolute faith in his luck. Men he had not seen in years grasped him
      by the hand and carelessly asked if he could tell of something good.
      Friends old and new begged him to dine with them, to immediately have a
      drink with them, at least to &ldquo;try&rdquo; a cigar. Men who protested they had
      lost their all begged for just a hint which would help them to come out
      even, and every one, without exception, assured him he was going to buy
      his latest book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to get it last night at a dozen news-stands,&rdquo; many of them said,
      &ldquo;but they told me the entire edition was exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of hungry-eyed race-goers waiting below the box, and watching
      Carter&rsquo;s every movement, distressed Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They look at you like a lot of starved dogs
      begging for a bone. Let&rsquo;s go home; we don&rsquo;t want to make any more money,
      and we may lose what we have. And I want it all to advertise the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not careful,&rdquo; said Carter, &ldquo;some one will buy that book and
      read it, and then you and Spink will have to take shelter in a cyclone
      cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he arose to make his bet on Ambitious, his friends from the club
      stand and a half-dozen of Pinkerton&rsquo;s men closed in around him and in a
      flying wedge pushed into the ring. The news-papers had done their work,
      and he was instantly surrounded by a hungry, howling mob. In comparison
      with the one of the previous day, it was as a foot-ball scrimmage to a run
      on a bank. When he made his first wager and the crowd learned the name of
      the horse, it broke with a yell into hundreds of flying missiles which
      hurled themselves at the book-makers. Under their attack, as on the day
      before, Ambitious receded to even money. There was hardly a person at the
      track who did not back the luck of the man who &ldquo;could not lose.&rdquo; And when
      Ambitious won easily, it was not the horse or the jockey that was cheered,
      but the young man in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      In New York the extras had already announced that he was again lucky, and
      when Dolly and Carter reached the bank they found the entire staff on hand
      to receive him and his winnings. They amounted to a sum so magnificent
      that Carter found for the rest of their lives the interest would furnish
      Dolly and himself an income upon which they could live modestly and well.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distinguished-looking, white-haired official of the bank congratulated
      Carter warmly. &ldquo;Should you wish to invest some of this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      should be glad to advise you. My knowledge in that direction may be wider
      than your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter murmured his thanks. The white-haired gentleman lowered his voice.
      &ldquo;On certain other subjects,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you know many things of which
      I am totally ignorant. Could you tell me,&rdquo; he asked carelessly, &ldquo;who will
      win the Suburban to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter frowned mysteriously. &ldquo;I can tell you better in the morning,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;It looks like Beldame, with Proper and First Mason within call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white-haired man showed his surprise and also that his ignorance was
      not as profound as he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the Keene entry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Carter doubtfully. &ldquo;If it were for a mile, I would say
      Delhi, but I don&rsquo;t think he can last the distance. In the morning I&rsquo;ll
      wire you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they settled back in their car, Carter took both of Dolly&rsquo;s hands in
      his. &ldquo;So far as money goes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are independent of your mother&mdash;independent
      of my books; and I want to make you a promise. I want to promise you that,
      no matter what I dream in the future, I&rsquo;ll never back another horse.&rdquo;
       Dolly gave a gasp of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; added Carter hastily, &ldquo;not another dollar can you risk
      in backing my books. After this, they&rsquo;ve got to stand or fall on their
      legs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried Dolly. &ldquo;Our plunging days are over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the flat they found waiting for Carter the junior
      partner of a real publishing house. He had a blank contract, and he wanted
      to secure the right to publish Carter&rsquo;s next book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a few short stories&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collections of short stories, protested the visitor truthfully, &ldquo;do not
      sell. We would prefer another novel on the same lines as &lsquo;The Dead Heat.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read &lsquo;The Dead Heat&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; admitted the publisher, &ldquo;but the next book by the same
      author is sure to&mdash;&mdash;. We will pay in advance of royalties
      fifteen thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you put that in writing?&rdquo; asked Carter. When the publisher was
      leaving he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your success in literature is equaled by your success at the races.
      Could you tell me what will win the Suburban?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send you a wire in the MORNING,&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had arranged to dine with some friends and later to visit a musical
      comedy. Carter had changed his clothes, and, while he was waiting for
      Dolly to dress, was reclining in a huge arm-chair. The heat of the day,
      the excitement, and the wear on his nerves caused his head to sink back,
      his eyes to close, and his limbs to relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, by her entrance, Dolly woke him, he jumped up in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been asleep,&rdquo; she mocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse!&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming! Shall I tell you who is going
      to win the Suburban?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champneys!&rdquo; cried Dolly in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Dolly,&rdquo; protested her husband, &ldquo;I promised to stop betting. I did
      not promise to stop sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed Dolly, with relief, &ldquo;as long as it stops at that. Delhi
      will win,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Delhi will not,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;This is how they
      will finish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He scribbled three names on a piece of paper
      which Dolly read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is what you told the gentleman at the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter stared at her blankly and in some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; cried Dolly, &ldquo;what you think when you&rsquo;re awake, you dream when
      you&rsquo;re asleep. And you had a run of luck that never happened before and
      could never happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter received her explanation with reluctance. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the theatre they found their host had reserved a stage-box,
      and as there were but four in their party, and as, when they entered, the
      house lights were up, their arrival drew upon them the attention both of
      those in the audience and of those on the stage. The theatre was crowded
      to its capacity, and in every part were people who were habitual
      race-goers, as well as many racing men who had come to town for the
      Suburban. By these, as well as by many others who for three days had seen
      innumerable pictures of him, Carter was instantly recognized. To the
      audience and to the performers the man who always won was of far greater
      interest than what for the three-hundredth night was going forward on the
      stage. And when the leading woman, Blanche Winter, asked the comedian
      which he would rather be, &ldquo;The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo or
      the Man Who Can Not Lose?&rdquo; she gained from the audience an easy laugh and
      from the chorus an excited giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at the end of the act, Carter went into the lobby to smoke, he was
      so quickly surrounded that he sought refuge on Broadway. From there, the
      crowd still following him, he was driven back into his box. Meanwhile, the
      interest shown in him had not been lost upon the press agent of the
      theatre, and he at once telephoned to the newspaper offices that Plunger
      Carter, the book-maker breaker, was at that theatre, and if that the
      newspapers wanted a chance to interview him on the probable out-come of
      the classic handicap to be run on the morrow, he, the press agent, would
      unselfishly assist them. In answer to these hurry calls, reporters of the
      Ten o&rsquo;Clock Club assembled in the foyer. How far what later followed was
      due to their presence and to the efforts of the press agent only that
      gentleman can tell. It was in the second act that Miss Blanche Winter sang
      her topical song. In it she advised the audience when anxious to settle
      any question of personal or national interest to &ldquo;Put it up to the Man in
      the Moon.&rsquo;&rdquo; This night she introduced a verse in which she told of her
      desire to know which horse on the morrow would win the Suburban, and, in
      the chorus, expressed her determination to &ldquo;Put it up to the Man in the
      Moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly from the back of the house a voice called: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put it
      up to the Man in the Box?&rdquo; Miss Winter laughed&mdash;the audience laughed; all
      eyes were turned toward Carter. As though the idea pleased them, from
      different parts of the house people applauded heartily. In embarrassment,
      Carter shoved back his chair and pulled the curtain of the box between him
      and the audience. But he was not so easily to escape. Leaving the
      orchestra to continue unheeded with the prelude to the next verse, Miss
      Winter walked slowly and deliberately toward him, smiling mischievously.
      In burlesque entreaty, she held out her arms. She made a most appealing
      and charming picture, and of that fact she was well aware. In a voice loud
      enough to reach every part of the house, she addressed herself to Carter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell ME?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carter, blushing unhappily, shrugged his shoulders in apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of her hand Miss Winter designated the audience. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she
      coaxed, reproachfully, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you tell THEM?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, instantly, with a promptness and unanimity that sounded
      suspiciously as though it came from ushers well rehearsed, several voice
      echoed her petition: &ldquo;Give us all a chance!&rdquo; shouted one. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep the
      good things to yourself!&rdquo; reproached another. &ldquo;I want to get rich, TOO!&rdquo;
       wailed a third. In his heart, Carter prayed they would choke. But the
      audience, so far from resenting the interruptions, encouraged them, and
      Carter&rsquo;s obvious discomfort added to its amusement. It proceeded to assail
      him with applause, with appeals, with commands to &ldquo;speak up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-clapping became general&mdash;insistent. The audience would not be
      denied. Carter turned to Dolly. In the recesses of the box she was
      enjoying his predicament. His friends also were laughing at him. Indignant
      at their desertion, Carter grinned vindictively. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he muttered
      over his shoulder. &ldquo;Since you think it&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo; He pulled
      his pencil from his watch-chain and, spreading his programme on the ledge
      of the box, began to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the audience there rose a murmur of incredulity, of surprise, of
      excited interest. In the rear of the house the press agent, after one
      startled look, doubled up in an ecstasy of joy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve landed him!&rdquo; he
      gasped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve landed him. He&rsquo;s going to fall for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly frantically clasped her husband by the coat-tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champ!&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite calmly, quite confidently, Carter rose. Leaning forward with a nod
      and a smile, he presented the programme to the beautiful Miss Winter. That
      lady all but snatched at it. The spot-light was full in her eyes. Turning
      her back that she might the more easily read, she stood for a moment, her
      pretty figure trembling with eagerness, her pretty eyes bent upon the
      programme. The house had grown suddenly still, and with an excited
      gesture, the leader of the orchestra commanded the music to silence. A man,
      bursting with impatience, broke the tense quiet. &ldquo;Read it!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a frightened voice that in the sudden hush held none of its usual
      confidence, Miss Winter read slowly: &ldquo;The favorite cannot last the
      distance. Will lead for the mile and give way to Beldame. Proper takes the
      place. First Mason will show. Beldame will win by a length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she had ceased reading, a dozen men had struggled to their feet and
      a hundred voice were roaring at her. &ldquo;Read that again!&rdquo; the chorused. Once
      more Miss Winter read the message, but before she had finished half of
      those in the front rows were scrambling from their seats and racing up the
      aisles. Already the reporters were ahead of them, and in the neighborhood
      not one telephone booth was empty. Within five minutes, in those hotels
      along the White Way where sporting men are wont to meet, betting
      commissioners and hand-book men were suddenly assaulted by breathless
      gentlemen, some in evening dress, some without collars, and some without
      hats, but all with money to bet against the favorite. And, an hour later,
      men, bent under stacks of newspaper &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; were vomited from the subway
      stations into the heart of Broadway, and in raucous tones were shrieking,
      &ldquo;Winner of the Suburban,&rdquo; sixteen hours before that race was run. That
      night to every big newspaper office from Maine to California, was flashed
      the news that Plunger Carter, in a Broadway theatre, had announced that
      the favorite for the Suburban would be beaten, and, in order, had named
      the three horses that would first finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up and down Broadway, from rathskellers to roof-gardens, in cafes and
      lobster palaces, on the corners of the cross-roads, in clubs and all-night
      restaurants, Carter&rsquo;s tip was as a red rag to a bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the boy drunk, they demanded, or had his miraculous luck turned his
      head? Otherwise, why would he so publicly utter a prophecy that on the
      morrow must certainly smother him with ridicule. The explanations were
      varied. The men in the clubs held he was driven by a desire for notoriety,
      the men in the street that he was more clever than they guessed, and had
      made the move to suit his own book, to alter the odds to his own
      advantage. Others frowned mysteriously. With superstitious faith in his
      luck, they pointed to his record. &ldquo;Has he ever lost a bet? How do WE know
      what HE knows?&rdquo; they demanded. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s fixed and he knows it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;wise&rdquo; ones howled in derision. &ldquo;A Suburban FIXED!&rdquo; they retorted.
      &ldquo;You can fix ONE jockey, you can fix TWO; but you can&rsquo;t fix sixteen
      jockeys! You can&rsquo;t fix Belmont, you can&rsquo;t fix Keene. There&rsquo;s nothing in
      his picking Beldame, but only a crazy man would pick the horse for the
      place and to show, and shut out the favorite! The boy ought to be in
      Matteawan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still undisturbed, still confident to those to whom he had promised them,
      Carter sent a wire. Nor did he forget his old enemy, &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; Burbank. &ldquo;If
      you want to get some of the money I took,&rdquo; he telegraphed, &ldquo;wipe out the
      Belmont entry and take all they offer on Delhi. He cannot win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that night, when each newspaper called him up at his flat, he made the
      same answer. &ldquo;The three horses will finish as I said. You can state that I
      gave the information as I did as a sort of present to the people of New
      York City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the papers the next morning &ldquo;Carter&rsquo;s Tip&rdquo; was the front-page feature.
      Even those who never in the racing of horses felt any concern could not
      help but take in the outcome of this one a curious interest. The audacity
      of the prophecy, the very absurdity of it, presupposing, as it did, occult
      power, was in itself amusing. And when the curtain rose on the Suburban it
      was evident that to thousands what the Man Who Could Not Lose had foretold
      was a serious and inspired utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time his friends gathered around him, not to benefit by his advice,
      but to protect him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll mob you!&rdquo; they warned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tear the
      clothes off your back. Better make your getaway now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly, with tears in her eyes, sat beside him. Every now and again she
      touched his hand. Below his box, as around a newspaper office on the night
      when a president is elected, the people crushed in a turbulent mob. Some
      mocked and jeered, some who on his tip had risked their every dollar,
      hailed him hopefully. On every side policemen, fearful of coming trouble,
      hemmed him in. Carter was bored extremely, heartily sorry he had on the
      night before given way to what he now saw as a perverse impulse. But he
      still was confident, still undismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all eyes, except those of Dolly, he was of all those at the track the
      least concerned. To her he turned and, in a low tone, spoke swiftly. &ldquo;I am
      so sorry,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;But, indeed, indeed, I can&rsquo;t lose. You must have
      faith in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In you, yes,&rdquo; returned Dolly in a whisper, &ldquo;but in your dreams, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horses were passing on their way to the post. Carter brought his face
      close to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to break my promise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and make one more bet, this one
      with you. I bet you a kiss that I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly, holding back her tears, smiled mournfully. &ldquo;Make it a hundred,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of the forty thousand at the track had backed Delhi, the other half,
      following Carter&rsquo;s luck and his confidence in proclaiming his convictions,
      had backed Beldame. Many hundred had gone so far as to bet that the three
      horses he had named would finish as he had foretold. But, in spite of
      Carter&rsquo;s tip, Delhi still was the favorite, and when the thousands saw the
      Keene polka-dots leap to the front, and by two lengths stay there, for the
      quarter, the half, and for the three-quarters, the air was shattered with
      jubilant, triumphant yells. And then suddenly, with the swiftness of a
      moving picture, in the very moment of his victory, Beldame crept up on the
      favorite, drew alongside, drew ahead passed him, and left him beaten. It
      was at the mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before a man had risen in a theatre and said to two thousand
      people: &ldquo;The favorite will lead for the mile, and give way to Beldame.&rdquo;
       Could they have believed him, the men who now cursed themselves might for
      the rest of their lives have lived upon their winnings. Those who had
      followed his prophecy faithfully, superstitiously, now shrieked in happy,
      riotous self-congratulation. &ldquo;At the MILE!&rdquo; they yelled. &ldquo;He TOLD you, at
      the MILE!&rdquo; They turned toward Carter and shook Panama hats at him. &ldquo;Oh,
      you Carter!&rdquo; they shrieked lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than a race the crowd was watching now, it was the working out
      of a promise. And when Beldame stood off Proper&rsquo;s rush, and Proper fell to
      second, and First Mason followed three lengths in the rear, and in that
      order they flashed under the wire, the yells were not that a race had been
      won, but that a prophecy had been fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the thousands that cheered Carter and fell upon him and indeed did tear
      his clothes off his back, one of his friends alone was sufficiently
      unselfish to think of what it might, mean to Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champ!&rdquo; roared his friend, pounding him on both shoulders. &ldquo;You old
      wizard! I win ten thousand! How much do you win?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter cast a swift glance at Dolly. He said, &ldquo;I win much more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Dolly, raising her eyes to his, nodded and smiled contentedly.
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
